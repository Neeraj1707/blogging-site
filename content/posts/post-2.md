ðŸŽˆ Why a Balloon Is a Flexible Bag
A balloon is often described as a flexible bag because of its material, structure, and function. It's made to expand, contract, and hold gases or liquids temporarily, which makes it both versatile and fascinating.

ðŸ“Œ What Makes It a "Bag"?
Shape and Purpose: A balloon has a container-like formâ€”it holds air, water, or gases, just like a bag holds objects.

Sealable Opening: Most balloons have an open end that can be tied or sealed, allowing them to trap their contents insideâ€”similar to how a drawstring bag works.

ðŸ“Œ Why Is It "Flexible"?
Made of Elastic Materials: Balloons are typically made from rubber, latex, silicone, or plastic. These materials are highly stretchable.

Can Change Shape Easily: A balloon can expand many times its original size without tearing (unless overstretched), adapting to the pressure of the air inside.

Returns to Original Form: When deflated, a balloon shrinks back close to its original sizeâ€”an example of elasticity, which is key to its flexibility.

ðŸ“˜ In Simple Terms:
A balloon is a flexible bag because it combines the capacity to hold things like a bag with the stretchy, moldable nature of elastic materials. It's designed to change shape and volume without breaking, making it ideal for fun, science experiments, decorations, and more!
