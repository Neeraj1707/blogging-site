Looking to add a dash of sparkle to your room décor or give your gifts a special touch? Our DIY Paper Diamond project is just the thing you need! It's a delightful mix of creativity and charm—perfect for both seasoned crafters and curious beginners. With just a few materials and a splash of imagination, you’ll be crafting eye-catching paper gems in no time. 💎

Whether you're redecorating your space or looking for a thoughtful handmade gift, this simple and stylish project will steal your heart.

#### ✂️ What You’ll Need

Colorful or metallic craft paper (thick is best for structure!)

Scissors ✂️

Pencil ✏️

Ruler 📏

Glue stick or double-sided tape

String (optional – for hanging your creations)

#### 📝 Let’s Make Magic: Step-by-Step Guide

1. Sketch Your Diamond Template:Flip your paper over and draw two identical diamond shapes. Precision matters—use your ruler to make sure both shapes match perfectly. Think of them as twin gems!

2. Cut & Fold:Carefully cut out your diamond shapes. Then fold each one in half down the center. Make those folds nice and crisp—they’ll help create that iconic 3D look.

3. Glue & Assemble:Apply glue or tape to the edges and gently press the two shapes together. If you're planning to hang your diamond, leave a little gap at the top for your string.

4. Personalize Your Diamond:This is where you can get fancy! Sprinkle on glitter, wrap with washi tape, or add stickers to make it your own. The possibilities are endless!

5. Display Your Sparkle:Once dry, hang your diamond from the ceiling, string it across your room, or place it as a centerpiece on your table. Instant style, handmade by you!
