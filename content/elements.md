Use headings to structure your content into clear sections.
In Markdown, the number of # symbols indicates the heading level.

# Heading 1 – Blog Title
## Heading 2 – Major Sections
### Heading 3 – Subsections
#### Heading 4 – Small Headings
##### Heading 5 – Rarely Used
###### Heading 6 – Very Small Headings
Example:
My Blogging Journey
Why I Started
The First Post
Lessons Learned
Tools I Use
Footnotes & Fine Print
✨ Emphasis
Markdown allows you to emphasize text using asterisks or underscores.

*Italic* or _Italic_  
**Bold** or __Bold__  
**Bold _and italic_**  
~~Strikethrough~~
Example:
This is italic text, this is bold text, and this is crossed out.

🔗 Links
Add clickable links easily:

[Inline link](https://example.com)

[Inline link with title](https://example.com "Hover text")

Reference-style [link][ref-name]

[ref-name]: https://example.com
Example:

📄 Paragraphs
Simply write as you normally would — Markdown formats paragraphs with a line break between them.

This is a paragraph of content for your blog post.

This is another paragraph with more detail.
